</abbr>
 is an upcoming playable <font color=aqua>Hydro</font> character in Genshin Impact.

As the God of Justice, Focalors, she oversees Fontaine as the current Hydro Archon.Undoubtedly, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3QqHYcs9uE">Furina</a> has been much loved by the people of Fontaine from the moment she became the Hydro Archon.

Her charismatic parlance, lively wit, and elegant bearing — all bear witness to her godly charms.

But perhaps the thing that she is most revered for is her unrivaled sense of drama.

As the protagonist of a famous play at the Opera Epiclese once put it,

"Life is like the theater — you never can tell when the twist will come."

Despite his human appearance, he is actually the Hydro<br>Sovereign, though not at his full power or dragonhood.
